# Time-web

This website was created as part of a project [AmaRadio.eu](https://amaradio.eu), since the whole code is interesting, I decided to publish it separately as well.

## Function

The main function of this site is to display the time. The time is obtained with the user's device. You can also display the time in any time zone. The website offers four color themes.

In the code, it is possible to uncomment the function that displays the difference between the user's time and the server's time. For this function, you need to get an API key from [timezonedb.com](https://timezonedb.com/).

```javascript
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
```

## Demo

You can try the demo version on this page [AmaRadio.eu/time](https://amaradio.eu/time)
